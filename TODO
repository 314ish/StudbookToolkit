* studbookRecord should include the ability to somehow store additional 'excel
lines'. There is a test file called test_moves_data.xlsx which is a good
example. These data correspond to data in test_excel_data.xlsx. How that's
represented in the structures is an open issue

* the example_usage.py file seems overly complex, it'd be nice to pare that
down to a simpler set of calls to the translators. This also implies
standardizing the translator libraries so the same calls work across different
formats

* need to improve documentation, explaining in the static files what the
purpose of all this is, how the translators relate to the studbook, etc.

* need to improve the reademe.md so it feels more good.
